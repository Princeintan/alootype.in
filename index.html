        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>What does Alootype Engineering Systems do?</h3>
        <p>
          Alootype Engineering Systems designs and develops custom laboratory
          instruments and experimental prototypes for research labs, academic
          groups, and startups.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Alootype build one-off prototypes?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Every system we build is tailored to a specific experimental
          requirement and delivered as a one-off or limited-run prototype with
          documentation.
        </p>

        <h3>Who typically works with Alootype?</h3>
        <p>
          We work with academic researchers, PhD scholars, hardware startups,
          and industrial teams requiring specialized instrumentation.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you provide documentation and support?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. All systems are delivered with clear documentation, and support
          is provided during deployment and initial operation.
        </p>

        <h3>Is Alootype suitable for early-stage research projects?</h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely. We regularly work on early-stage and exploratory research
          projects where commercial instruments are unavailable or unsuitable.
